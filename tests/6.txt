Currently, nearly every major industry involves computers in some form, thus providing a massive variety of job opportunities. Likewise, because technology is continuously progressing, the future of computer science will undoubtedly lead to many new and exciting opportunities. Seeing as technology is playing a larger role in our lives every day, wouldn't it make sense to teach people how to use this technology properly? I have worked in the industry and from my experience I have had the opportunity to work with a great team of people, learn new things and expand my knowledge, and have a career that has large growth potential. Computing is one of those fields where it is almost impossible to predict what will happen next. Therefore, we cannot even begin to imagine all the ways
that you can contribute to it and it can make your lifeâ€™s work exciting and real.
