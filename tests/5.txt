Computer science is becoming a part of almost everything we do nowadays. It is
a discipline that offers rewarding and challenging possibilities for a wide
range of people regardless of their range of interests. Computing requires and
develops capabilities in solving deep, multidimensional problems requiring
imagination and sensitivity to a variety of concerns. Computing jobs are among
the highest paid and have the highest job satisfaction. Computing is very
often associated with innovation, and developments in computing tend to drive
it. Computing is one of those fields where it is almost impossible to predict
what will happen next. Therefore, we cannot even begin to imagine all the ways
that you can contribute to it and it can make your lifeâ€™s work exciting and
real.
