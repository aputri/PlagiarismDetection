Why should students in high school study computer science? Well, why do we study English? English is used extensive in communications with others. Similarly, computer science is used as a tool to communicate with computers. Seeing as technology is playing a larger role in our lives every day, wouldn't it make sense to teach people how to use this technology properly? Imagine if English was not required, literacy abilities would slide backwards. In current society, the lack of knowledge about technology has created significant privacy issues and ridiculous debates such as the one on encryption. Considering this, it is inexcuseable to _not_ teach computer science to high school students.
