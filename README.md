# Plagiarism Detection


A Python program to check if a document's contents are plagiarised.

## Pseudocode


Compute containment C_n(A,B), for n = 1..10 (inclusive). 

Create the set of unigrams in text A (S_A) and the set of unigrams in text B (S_B) for n=1.

Determine the size of the intersection of the two sets and the size of S_B to calculate C_1(A,B). 

Create the set of bigrams S_A and S_B in computing C_2(A,B) for n=2. 

Repeat for each of n=3, ..., 10. 

## Test


Run Python program with test files provided.
